#### Weclome to my Github Readme!

I work as a software engineer for [FundThatFlip](https://www.fundthatflip.com/), where we leverage technology to build lasting relationships and provide extraordinary experiences, empowering investors to create wealth and improve communities. In my role, I primarily use Ruby and Typescript/JavaScript.

On the side, I enjoy exploring different technologies, building, breaking, and learning while having fun to better myself in the process. Currently, on weekends, I am tinkering with a [multiplayer game built using Golang and gRPC](https://github.com/kainn9/go_grpc_multiplayer_game_example_attempt):
